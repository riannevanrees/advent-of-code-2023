The setup has been copy-pasted from papa's setup, so I am not completely certain what everything does.

	$ python3 -m venv .
	$ bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

Pytest is listed in the requirements. So for testing, I can use a variation of the following command:

	$ bin/pytest day01

To get the solution, the following command can be run:

	$ bin/python day01/star1.py
